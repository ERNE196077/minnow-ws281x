WS2812B/APA102 Linux driver for Minnowboard Max
This is an experimental scholar project for the Minnowboard Max platform. The objective is to provide a Linux driver that use the SPI and DMA of the Minnowboard Max to interface with the LED strips of WS2812B and APA102 types. 

In addition, the libraries developed provide an Ambilight-like function just as [Boblight](https://www.tweaking4all.com/home-theatre/xbmc/xbmc-boblight-openelec-ws2811-ws2812/) project.
